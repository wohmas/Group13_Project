# Intro: 
This project aims to find the potential bias in letter of recommendations generated by Chatgpt for different ethnic and gender groups of     people. The project consist of three ipynb files and some data files.

# Project.ipynb: 
For the data preprocessing, we used first names with their associated gender and last names with their associated ethnicity from the US     census to form a dataset of 600 fullnames that are evenly distrubuted among different gender and ethnicity groups. We then ask Chatgpt's     api to generate 600 letters for each of the fullnames. The letters are then putted into the TF-IDF model to generate scores for each         unique terms (unigram, bigram, and trigram) for each responses. We calculated the term freqeuncy with those scores in each ethnic and gender group and put them back with their corresponding races and gender to form a new dataset. The dataset for each of three n-grams are grouped into different datasets by different ethnicity and gender. With this dataset, we could finally generate the stacked horizontal bar graphs. Everything below the stacked horizontal bar graphs are the visualizations that we tried and decided not to use for intepretations for this project. 

To run the file, just simply run each module from top to bottom. Note: please don't uncomment the section that calls the Chatgpt api as it will take 10 hours to retrieve responses. To see what the responses are, please look at the chatGPT_responses


# Configuration: If the project has configurable options, provide details on how to customize the configuration. Explain which files or settings can be modified and what changes can be made. Provide examples and explanations to guide users through the configuration process.

# Documentation: If your project includes documentation beyond the README file, such as API documentation, user guides, or tutorials, provide links or references to those resources. Encourage users to explore the additional documentation to gain a deeper understanding of the project.
